# Rejections of developer.apple.com


## This file is a compilation of all the rejections that Apple made to the app that we are developing with my colleagues in our company.


The referenced documentation is the one available to ios developers, in this [link](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#intellectual-property)





## 5.2.1

Here apple rejects us because we are trying to develop an App for a third party, and Apple apparently requires that this third part to open its own developer account.


```
5.2.1 Generally: Don’t use protected third party material such as trademarks, copyrighted works,
or patented ideas in your app without permission, and don’t include misleading, false, or copycat 
representations, names, or metadata in your app bundle or developer name.
Apps should be submitted by the person or legal entity that owns or has licensed the intellectual
property and other relevant rights and is responsible for offering any services provided by the app.
```


Here is a response from a member of the Apple team:
